 3. It was also identified that over 95% of its Revenue were generated during working days compared to other working periods.



### Recommendations
---

 1. SkillHarvest should invest more in the Region contributing more to its Revenue, especially the service plan line of business.

 2. Since bulk of its Revenue is been generated during the normal working days (95%), I will strong recommend the company employees more employe to work on the normal working days and give incentive for overtime and allow staff rest on weekends/ holidays so they can be more productive during the coming week.

 3. SKillHarvest should pay keen attention to the reason why there is a drop in Revenue in 2015.
